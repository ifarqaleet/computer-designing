I/O Devices: 

Def: 
Program controlled I/O: Consider a task that reads characters
typed on a keyboard, stores these data in the memory, and displays the same characters on a display screen. A simple way of implementing this task is to write a program that performs all functions needed to realize the desired action. This method is known as program-controlled I/O.

the program enters a wait loop in which it repeatedly
tests the device status. During this period, the processor is not performing any useful
computation. There are many situations where other tasks can be performed while waiting
for an I/O device to become ready. To allow this to happen, we can arrange for the I/O
device to alert the processor when it becomes ready. It can do so by sending a hardware
signal called an interrupt request to the processor.

interrupts: 

Just as interrupt comes, the PC (that saves addressing of the next instruction to be executed) is fed with the address of the first program line in the interrupt. 
As it completes I it moves to the interrupt. 
After completing all interrupt tasks, it moves back to I+1, in order to go back to the I+1 task, it must save the addresses of I+1 elsewhere in a temporary memory so that it can replace the PC with the address of I+1 once we are at the last instruction of the interrupt.
