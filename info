Register file: A register file is a collection of registers inside the CPU that can be accessed quickly by the processor for storing temporary data, instructions, or addresses. It acts like a small, ultra-fast memory bank where the CPU keeps the values it is actively working with.


DATA PATH
The datapath is like a network of functional units connected by buses and multiplexers, controlled by signals from the control unit.
Datapath = Operations
Control Unit = Brain that tells the datapath what to do.
