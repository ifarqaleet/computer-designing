Lets say a task taks 100 units of time and of which 40 are sequential while 60 are parallel with single processor used. If 2 and 4 are used respectively what will be the time. 

answer : for sequential (series) - the time remains teh same no matter what while for parallel there will be a difference in the nature. 
for two processors instead of 1 the parallel part will be divided by two. i.e. 

40 + 60/2 = 70 

 for 4 processors the parallel part will be further divided. 

40 + 30/2 = 55
