with referece to the memory there are there three concepts - 
1) Cocst 2) Speed 3) Size 

There are various types of memories in a computer such as - registers, main memory, secondary memory, cache memory. 

Main memory - second largest (within computer)  (slowest but least expensive) 
Secondary - largest 
Cache memory - closet  to CPU 
Register - within a CPU (fastest and most expensive) 

CPU - generates only the logical address. 

We use locality of reference in most cases to ensure that we get the data early hand
