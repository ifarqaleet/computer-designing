Some concepts: 

Stages: A stage is like every step of a work. IF we divide a work in 5 steps then each step is a stage. In Pipelining, stage means one of - IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB 
Clock cycle: One tick of a CPU clock. During Clock cycle each stage can do its work. 
For one instruction - cycles required per instruction (CPI) should be == 1 for pipelined one 
For none pipelined one its generally == number of stages. 

Clock freqency = How many cycles are reuqired per unit time.

there are differenet types of hazards when we study pipelining. Naming - Structral, control and data hazards. 


Structural Hazards: 
These often arise due hardware issues such as memory being busy. If memory is busy in some other work, then stalling happens and time gets wasted 

Control hazards: 
These occur and arise due to branching.



Some very important concepts: 

- Operand Forwarding (theory and numerical) 
- Multiple processors involved (Core) (1 question came) 
- Chart making based questions 
- Idea of operand forwarding 
- Stalls and CPI 
- Definition of all
