There are several parts of a control unit but mainly, 

CPU, ALU and registers. 

CPU - central processing unit , ALU - Arithmetic logic unit Processors. 

Computers are of two types, General purpose and dedicated 

main elements - 

memory 
alu
 reigster 
timing circuits 
control unit 
flags 
bus

etc 

memory heirarchy 

memory -> registers -> ALU -> registers -> memory 

there needs to make several additions here. ** 


Multiplexers are controlled by signals that select which input data appear at the mul-
tiplexerâ€™s output. For example, when B_select is equal to 0, MuxB selects the contents of
register RB to be available at input InB of the ALU. Note that two bits are needed to control
MuxC and MuxY, because each multiplexer selects one of three inputs.
