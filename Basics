For hexadecimal nos remember that: 
If we add 

1 byte to hexadecimal then it will add 1 to it. HEX WORKS IN BYTE. EG 

if HEX is (041E)H then adding 1 byte will mean -> (041F), adding more +1 -> (0420) 



----
Overfow: 
If Cin to the most significant bit and Cout from the most significant bit are different than the two numbers addition will lead to overflow. 
This condition goes true for 2s complementation.
